He inherited the County of Tripoli upon his father's death in 1187. The County of Tripoli was one of the major crusader states established during the First Crusade.\n\n*Reign as Count of Tripoli*\nRaymond III faced challenges from the growing power of Saladin the Sultan of Egypt and Syria. In 1189 Saladin conquered the remaining territories of the Kingdom of Jerusalem leaving only the coastal cities under crusader control. Raymond III allied with Guy of Lusignan the King of Jerusalem and other crusader leaders to resist Saladin's advances. However their efforts were unsuccessful and in 1191 Saladin's forces captured the city of Acre after a prolonged siege.\n\n*Conflict with the Knights Templar*\nRaymond III had a long-standing feud with the Knights Templar a powerful military order. The Templars held significant territories and castles within the County of Tripoli. In 1187 Raymond III accused the Templars of treachery during the Battle of Cresson and attempted to seize their lands. This led to open conflict between Raymond III and the Templars which continued until his death in 1187. The Templars refused to recognize Raymond's heir and instead supported an rival claimant to the County of Tripoli."}
