He was the son of Raymond II and Hodierna of Jerusalem. Raymond III succeeded his father as the Count of Tripoli after his death in 1152.\n\n*Early Life and Succession*\nRaymond III was born around 1140 to Raymond II and Hodierna of Jerusalem. His mother was the daughter of King Baldwin II of Jerusalem and his wife Morphia of Melitene. Raymond III succeeded his father as the Count of Tripoli after his death in 1152. At the time of his succession Raymond III was still a minor and the regency was held by his mother Hodierna.\n\nRaymond III played a significant role in the politics of the Kingdom of Jerusalem. In 1160 he was betrothed to Hodierna's niece Princess Melisende of Jerusalem but the marriage never took place. In 1164 Raymond III was captured by the forces of Nur ad-Din during the Battle of Harim. He was released in 1173 after being held captive for nine years.\n\n*The Regency of the Kingdom of Jerusalem*\nIn 1174 Raymond III was appointed as the regent of the Kingdom of Jerusalem for the young King Baldwin IV. He held the position until 1176 when he was removed by the king's mother Agnes of Courtenay. Raymond III was reappointed as the regent in 1183 after the death of Agnes of Courtenay. He held the position until 1184 when he was removed by the king's sister Sibylla of Jerusalem.\n\n*The Battle of Hattin*\nIn 1187 Raymond III played a significant role in the Battle of Hattin. He advised King Guy of Lusignan to avoid battle with the forces of Saladin but his advice was ignored. The Crusader army was defeated and many of its leaders including King Guy of Lusignan were captured. Raymond III escaped the battle and fled to Tyre. He died in 1187 while on his way to Antioch.\n\nRaymond III's death marked the end of the County of Tripoli. The county was eventually absorbed into the Kingdom of Jerusalem. Raymond III's legacy is still remembered today as one of the most important figures in the history of the Crusades."}

HOWEVER, IT ALSO OVERSIMPLIFIES THE COMPLEX ISSUE OF WHEN AND HOW TO DISREGARD THE LAW. IN REALITY, THE DECISION TO BREAK THE LAW SHOULD BE BASED ON A THOUGHTFUL ANALYSIS OF THE LAW'S IMPACT, THE POTENTIAL CONSEQUENCES OF DISOBEDIENCE, AND THE AVAILABILITY OF ALTERNATIVE MEANS OF ADDRESSING THE ISSUE.\n\nPARAGRAPH 2\nFURTHERMORE, THE SENTENCE FAILS TO PROVIDE ANY GUIDANCE ON HOW TO DETERMINE WHETHER A LAW IS \"BAD\". IS IT BAD BECAUSE IT IS UNJUST, UNCONSTITUTIONAL, OR MERELY INCONVENIENT? WITHOUT A CLEAR CRITERION FOR EVALUATING THE QUALITY OF A LAW, THE SENTENCE BECOMES LITTLE MORE THAN A VAGUE EXHORTATION TO DISREGARD THE RULE OF LAW. INSTEAD OF PROVIDING A USEFUL FRAMEWORK FOR THINKING ABOUT CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE, THE SENTENCE SEEMS TO ENCOURAGE A SELF-SERVING AND ARBITRARY APPROACH TO THE LAW."}
